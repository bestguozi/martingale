# Active Context: Multi-User Martingale System (2025-04-09)

## Current Status

âœ… **Completed:**
1. Implemented multi-user architecture with database persistence
2. Created MySQL schema using Prisma ORM
3. Developed core services:
   - `userService`: Manages users and API key metadata
   - `logService`: Structured logging to console and database
   - `strategyService`: Coordinates strategy lifecycle
4. Implemented `MartingaleEngine` with event-driven design
5. Implemented encrypted API key storage in database
6. Created main application entry point (`app.js`) 
7. Updated all Memory Bank documentation

## Current Focus

1. Final testing and verification of multi-user functionality
2. Documentation review and completion
3. Planning for next phase features

## Recent Changes

- Refactored monolithic script into modular architecture
- Replaced file-based state with database persistence
- Implemented service layer architecture
- Added database logging transport
- Improved error handling and recovery
- Removed old `gridbot.js` file
- Updated all documentation

## Next Steps

1. **Testing:**
   - Verify multi-user isolation
   - Test strategy recovery after restart
   - Validate credential security

2. **Features:**
   - Implement REST API for management
   - Add web interface
   - Develop monitoring dashboard

3. **Security:**
   - Add user authentication
   - Implement API key rotation
   - Set up database backups

## Technical Considerations

- **Performance:** Monitor strategy scaling with multiple users
- **Security:** Regular credential audits and encryption
- **Reliability:** Handle exchange API downtime gracefully
- **Maintenance:** Database migration planning
- **Monitoring:** Real-time strategy health checks

## Key Decisions

1. **Database over Files:** Chose MySQL for reliability and multi-user support
2. **Modular Architecture:** Services for clear separation of concerns
3. **Event-Driven:** Engine emits events for loose coupling
4. **Credential Security:** Encrypted storage in database
5. **Logging:** Database transport for audit trail
