# Cline Rules & Project Intelligence for Multi-User Martingale System (Updated 2025-04-11)

## Architectural Decisions

1. **Modular Service Architecture:**
   - Services: `userService`, `logService`, `strategyService`
   - Engine: `MartingaleEngine` as standalone component
   - Pattern: Event-driven communication between components

2. **Database Design:**
   - MySQL with Prisma ORM
   - Multi-user data model with proper relations
   - Sensitive data storage strategy (see Security Implementation)

3. **Security Implementation:**
   - API secrets (Secret Keys) are encrypted using `aes-256-gcm` via `src/lib/crypt.js`.
   - Encrypted data (including salt, iv, content, tag) is stored in the database alongside public key metadata.
   - Encryption requires a master password (managed outside the codebase, e.g., environment variable or secure vault).
   - All operations logged for audit

## Key Implementation Patterns

4. **State Management:**
   - Database persistence for strategy state
   - Automatic recovery on restart
   - Atomic updates via transactions

5. **Error Handling:**
   - Structured error logging
   - Critical error recovery procedures
   - Exchange API error classification

6. **Performance Considerations:**
   - Staggered order checks
   - Rate limit handling
   - Connection pooling

## Project Conventions

7. **Code Organization:**
   - `src/` structure:
     - `core/`: Strategy implementations
     - `services/`: Business logic
     - `lib/`: Shared utilities
     - `config/`: Configuration files
   - Single entry point: `app.js`

8. **Documentation Standards:**
   - Memory Bank kept up-to-date
   - Code comments for complex logic
   - API documentation (future)

## Maintenance Notes

9. **Database Operations:**
   - Migrations: `npx prisma migrate dev`
   - Backups: Regular database dumps
   - Monitoring: Query performance

10. **Deployment Considerations:**
    - Environment variables for configuration
    - Process management (PM2/systemd)
    - Log rotation
    - Secure management of the master encryption password.
